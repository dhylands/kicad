- FlatCam needs filled poygons in order to do edge cuts properly.
  Kicad doesn't create filled polygons.
  So I created a script which converts lines into a filled polygon

  fill-edge-cuts.py Nanino8-Edge.Cuts.gbr

  This generates Nanino8-Edge.Cuts-filled.gbr

- In pcbNew
	- Set the grid origin (Place->Grid Origin) and click in bottom left of arduino board
	- Set Drill and Place Offset (aka aux axis) to bottom left corner of board
		- This sets the origin for the gerber/gcode files.
	- When plotting gerbers, check "Use auxilliary axis as origin"
	- When making drill files. Set Drill Origin to "Auxilliary axis"
	- In gerber viewer, confirm origin location
	- For http://dangerousprototypes.com/store/pcbs Check "Use Protel file extensions"
	  and the rename-gerbers.py script.

- python flatcam.py
	- Import gerbers
		Nanino8-B.Cu.gbr
		Nanino8-Edge.Cuts-filled.gbr
	- Import Excellon
		Nanino8.drl
		Nanino8-NPTH.drl

	- Double click on Nanino8-Edge.Cuts-filled.gbr
		- Board cutout only cuts out rectangular
		- so we use isolation routing with a larger endmill
			3.125 mm (1/8")
		- generate geometry

	- Add Tabs
		- click on the "Projects" tab
		- Click once on the Nanino8-B-Edge-Cuts-filled.gbr_iso geometry
		- Edit->Edit-Geometry
		- Click on rectangle and draw out tabs
			- Click-Drag and then click again when done
			- Want tabs about 2 endmill widths wide
			- Press ESC (should highlight the Arrow)
			- Click on the outline and Control-Click the tabs in that order
			- Drawing->Cut-Path
			- Press ESC
			- Click on first tab and control-Click on the rest of the tabs
			- Drawing->Delete Shape
			- Edit->Update Geometry
			- Should now have a path with some gaps in it
	- Double click on Nanino8-B.Cu.gbr
		- 0.48mm (0.019")
		- generate geometry
	- Double click on Nanino8-NPTH.drl
		- Mill Holes - 3.125mm
	- Double click on Nanino8.drl
		- Can either drill or mill
		- to mill pick a small mill (smaller than the smallest hole)
			- generate geometry
		- to drill 
			- pick Cut Z -2mm
			- Travel Z 3 mm
			- Feed rate 75 mm/min
	- Double click on Nanino8-NPTH.drl_mill
		CutZ -2 mm
		TravelZ 3 mm
		Feed Rate 150 mm/min
		Tool dia: 3.125mm
		- Generate
	- Double click on Nanino8-B.Cu.gbr_iso
		CutX .15 mm
		TravelZ 3 mm
		Feed Rate: 380 mm/min
		Tool Dia: 0.5 mm
		- Generate
	- Double click on Nanino8-B-Edge-Cuts-filled.gbr_iso
		CutZ -2 mm
		TravelZ 3 mm
		Feed Rate 150 mm/min
		Tool dia: 3.125mm
		- Generate

Not verified!
Isolation feed rate 15 IPM = 380 mm/min
Edge cut feed rate 6 IPM = 150 mm/min
