Tools required
- soldering iron
- solder (leaded is easier)
- flux
- flush cutters
- Needle nose piers (or hemostats)


- Solder R1 & R2 (1K - brown - black - red)
- Solder R3 (10K - brown - black - orange)
- If using a right-angle header for the serial port, solder that on now.
- Solder C1, C3, and C4 (small blue or beige caps)
- Drill out the 2 holes for the RESET switch with a #53 drill bit
  - Solder the Reset Switch. Since we drilled out the hole there is a possibility
    that the via was drilled out as well, you may need to solder the lead closest
    to the ISP connector on the top side as well.
- Solder the DIP socket. The notched side of the DIP socket goes towards the
  reset switch. Solder one corner and the diagonally opposite corner. Make sure
  that the socket is flush with the board. If it isn't remelt the solder on the
  corner pins while pressing the socket. When it's flush, then solder the remaining
  pins and re-solder the 2 corner pins.
- Solder the RED LED in the PWR (D2) and the GREEN LED in LED (D1). The flat side
  of the LED (the shorter of the 2 leads) goes in the square pad marked 'K'.
- Solder the ceramic resonator (X1).
- If desired, solder the ISP header on
- If using a straight header for the serial port, solder it now
- Solder the 100 uf Electrolytic cap (or the smaller 10 uF cap). The negative (shorted lead) goes in the
  square pad. You may want to use the smaller cap if you're planning on using a shield
  (just so that it doesn't bump into things).
- If desired, solder 2 pin power headers into P8, P9 and/or the VCC/GND bus
- If desired, solder the 2 single pin headers onto 3V3 and VIN
- If desired, solder the I/O headers

- Provide power to the board and verify that the RED LED turns on.
- Remove power from the board.

Plug in all six wires from the USB serial adpater into the serial connector.
Note that RXI from the serial adpter plugs into TXO on the board, and
TXO on the board plugs into RXI on serial adapter. So all six pins from the
serial adapter plug in directly in the same order into the board.

Gently bend the pins on the ATMega328 chip so that they're parallel and carefully
plug it into the DIP socket. Apply power. The green LED should blink with what
I call a heartbeat pattern (2 quick flashes per second).
